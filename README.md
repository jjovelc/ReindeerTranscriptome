# ReindeerTranscriptome

## Description of Project

In adult mammals, deep skin injuries heal by rapid repopulation with reactive fibroblasts that deposit extracellular matrix and form fibrotic scar tissue. Discovery of a tight-skinned, free-living mammal that exhibits both skin regeneration and fibrotic repair would enable comparative insights that better contextualizes human healing. In reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), antlers are regenerated annually in both sexes and grow at an explosive rate exceeding 1 cm in length each day. Growing antlers are covered by specialized skin called velvet. Therefore, antler velvet itself may harbor innate regenerative capacity and could represent a unique model to study the molecular events enabling adult skin regeneration.

Despite considerable endeavors, a well annotated genome and transcriptome are still missing for the reindeer. In collaboration with Drs. Claude Robert and Julien Prunier (University of Laval) and Dr. Juha Kantanen (Natural Resources Institute of Findland), we initiated an effort to assembly the reindeer transcriptome. Here we describe the bioinformatics procedures undertaken.
